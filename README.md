We aim to forecast precipitation and temperature for next 2 to 3 hours by using past meteorological stations data with different parameters like Humidity,
Minimum , maximum Temperature, Precipitation, wind speed, etc. In context of Nepal, Numerical Weather Forecasting is adopted which needs high processing PC along with long computational
time so this raises so many problems in Agriculture, floods, and so on.

It will contains different folders associated with different tasks.
# LSTMModels and Dataset
The LSTM models for forecasting the air temperature and precipitation at different stations are within this folder. All the models are mentioned in the naming convention itself (eg to run airport hourly precipitaiton model, there is a model with name AirportHourlyPrecipitation.ipynb: inside airport station folder indicating the station name and precipitatio or temperature as a name). Download all the packages before run and the model's data can be accessed via CleanedFinalDataset Folder. 

# Weather Portal
The final visualization of the output of models can be seen through weather portal. The weather portal can be accessed from [Here](https://github.com/Kapil-bit/Web-portal).
