# Weather Forecasting
We aim to forecast precipitation and temperature for next 2/3 hours by using the past meteorological staion data with different parameter like Humidity,
Min/Max Temperature, Precipitation etc. In context of Nepal, Numerical Weather Forecasting is adopted which needs high processing PC along with long computational
time so this raises so many problems in Agriculture, Flood ans so on. In this Project it contains the raw data, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,
ML modeling( we will use LSTM).
