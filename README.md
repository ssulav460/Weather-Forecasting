We aim to forecast precipitation and temperature for next 2 to 3 hours by using past meteorological station data with different parameters like Humidity,
Minimum , maximum Temperature, Precipitation, wind speed, etc. In context of Nepal, Numerical Weather Forecasting is adopted, which requires a high-processing PC along with long computational
time so this raises so many problems in Agriculture, floods, and so on.

It will contain different folders associated with different tasks.
# LSTMModels and Dataset
The LSTM models for forecasting the air temperature and precipitation at different stations are within this folder. All the models are mentioned in the naming convention itself (e.g., to run the airport hourly precipitation model, there is a model with the name AirportHourlyPrecipitation.ipynb inside the airport station folder, indicating the station name and precipitation or temperature as a name). Download all the packages before running, and the model's data can be accessed via the CleanedFinalDataset Folder. 

# Outlier Handling and Data Cleaning
This contain the sample code of percentile approach of handling outliers and data cleaning process of few dataframe.

# Visualization
This contain the visualization of the dataset for further analysis and take action.

# Weather Portal
The final visualization of the output of models can be seen through the weather portal. The weather portal can be accessed from [Here](https://github.com/Kapil-bit/Web-portal).
